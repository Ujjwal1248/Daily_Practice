. The shortest JS code is an empty JS file.
. Whenever a JS code runs, a global execcution context(GEC) is created. Inside that GEC we have 2 phases
    => Memory Creation Phase MCP
    => Code Execution PHase CEP
. MCP runs when 0 line of code is executed that is before the CEP, the role of MCP is to allocate memory
    => To all the variables
    => To all the functions
. The role of CEP is to execute after MCP and to run the code line by line.
. All the JS code is getting executed because of call stack, GEC is actually running inside the call stack.
. Whenever any function executes, a new execution context is created and the name of newly created executed context is  same as that the name of function
** Whenever GEC is created along with that Global Object (Window) is also created.
