    API create

DataBase=>
    CRUD
    Populate
    Indexing

Authentication and Authorization(JWT Tokens)

React=>
    Advantages and Disadvantages
    Virtual DOM => React Fibre, Diffing Algo, reconsilation
    Lifecycle of React Component => CDM, CDU, CWUM => useEffect teeno ko use kr skta h
    useState() => Batching
    useEffect() => Dependency Array
    Memo(), useMemo(), uesCallBack(), useRef()
    Lazy Loading => Sequence FallBack
    Prop Drilling (to overcome this we use Context Approach)
    React Router DOM => Create Browser ROuter
    Link v/s useNavigate()
    Store, slice, actions, reducer frequency, Subscribe selector
